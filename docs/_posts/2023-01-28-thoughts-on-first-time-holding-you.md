<h2 class="post-headings">Thoughts On The First Time Holding You!</h2>

As I hold you in my arms, my dear baby Mira, I want you to know that from the moment you were born, our hearts were filled with a sense of hope and endless possibilities. You are a precious new life that your mother, myself and your older sister are honored to be a part of, and we are all filled with a deep sense of love and protectiveness towards you. We can't wait to take you home from the hospital and start our life together as a family of 4!

We want to be there for you at every step of your journey and to always be a source of support and guidance as you grow and explore the world. Watching you discover new things is one of the most exciting aspects of being your father. To the first time you reach out and grab a toy, to your first steps and your first words, we want to be there to witness and be a part of it all. We want to be the ones to encourage your curiosity and to help you learn about the world around you. We will be there to teach you how to ride a bike, to help you with your homework and to answer your questions about life.

As you grow older, we will be there to support your interests and passions. Whether you love sports, art, music or science, we will be there to help you pursue it and achieve your goals. We will be there to cheer you on and to be your biggest fans. We know that we will never be able to fully protect you from the challenges of life, but we will always be there to guide you, to give you the tools you need to face those challenges and to be a source of love and support. We will always be your family, your father, mother and sister.
